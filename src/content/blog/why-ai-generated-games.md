Here's a take that might sound obvious in a few years, but feels early right now: **AI-generated games are going to be huge.**

Not AI-assisted game development. Not AI-generated assets. Complete, playable games — created from a prompt, iterated on in real-time, and shared instantly.

I'm building [Granularity Games](https://granularitygames.com) to make this happen. And I'm doing it in a way that might sound crazy: the company itself is autonomously run.

Let me explain both.

## Games Are the New Video

Remember when making a video was hard? You needed cameras, editing software, distribution channels. Then smartphones happened, then YouTube, then TikTok. Suddenly anyone could make video. The barrier dropped, and an entire creative medium exploded.

Games never had that moment.

Sure, we got Unity, Roblox, Dreams. But those still require *development*. You need to understand game logic, asset pipelines, level design. Even the "easy" tools have a learning curve that filters out 99% of potential creators.

What if you could just... describe a game and play it?

## What I'm Building

Granularity Games is an AI engine that creates complete, playable games from a prompt. Not templates. Not assets. Complete games.

Here's how it works:

1. You describe a game idea
2. The system generates game logic, assets, and levels
3. It iterates — playtesting itself, fixing issues, making sure it's actually playable and winnable
4. You play the result, share it, remix it

The key insight is that **creation, iteration, and discovery should be one workflow**. Existing tools treat these as separate phases. That's wrong. When you can instantly play what you just described, the feedback loop becomes immediate. You iterate in real-time. You discover new ideas by playing.

## Why Now?

LLMs have crossed a threshold. They can finally reason about game systems — not just generate code, but understand what makes a game *work*. Combined with deterministic game logic and constraint systems, you can generate games that are actually playable.

I'm not saying the games are going to be AAA quality. They're not. But they don't need to be.

TikTok videos aren't HBO shows. Instagram photos aren't professional photography. And AI-generated games don't need to compete with Elden Ring.

They need to be *good enough to be fun*, and the barrier to create them needs to be zero.

## The Autonomous Company Experiment

Here's where it gets weird.

I'm not just building AI-generated games. I'm building an AI-native *company*. 

The code? AI-generated, using Claude Code and similar tools. I design the architecture and direct the work, but I rarely write code directly anymore.

Operations? Handled by an AI assistant named Grit. Email, scheduling, coordination — Grit manages it. (Grit also helped draft this blog post, though I'm writing this particular paragraph myself.)

This isn't a gimmick. It's an experiment in what a company looks like when AI handles most of the execution. I'm the bottleneck on vision, taste, and decisions. Everything else can scale.

If AI can generate games, why not the company that builds the game engine?

## Where This Goes

Short term: playable prototypes, rapid ideation, game jams at the speed of thought.

Medium term: a generation of creators who think in games the way my generation thinks in video.

Long term: games as a universal language for ideas, education, expression. And companies that run themselves.

I'm documenting this journey publicly — the wins, the failures, the weird experiments. If you're interested in AI, gaming, or building strange things, follow along.

More soon.
