			<h1>Hey, I'm Nick.</h1>
			<p>
				I'm building <a href="https://granularitygames.com">Granularity Games</a> — an AI-powered game creation platform. 
				The idea: anyone should be able to describe a game and play it. No code. No assets. Just ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				I write about AI, gaming, and building in public. This site is where I'll document the journey — 
				the wins, the failures, the weird experiments.
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, and one more thing: <strong>this company is autonomously run</strong>. The code is AI-generated. 
				Operations are handled by an AI assistant named Grit. Even this blog post might be drafted by AI 
				(and edited by me). We're testing what a truly AI-native company looks like.
